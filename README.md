## 1. Introduction
Interface to API application
Information State Update (ISU)
Develop a travel recommendation application whose main function is to recommend tourist restaurants, activities, etc. 
Use a travel information API, such as the TripAdvisor API or Yelp API, to get details, reviews, locations, and so on about individual restaurants.
### Yelp Fusion API
Website of API: https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/getting-started  
Provide detailed information about restaurants, hotels, attractions, etc., including opening hours, user reviews, ratings, etc.
Support location query (by city, latitude and longitude, etc.), category filtering (such as restaurants, cafes, attractions, etc.).
Support for multiple languages and partial international data, which is very useful when developing global applications.

## 2. Data collection
### 2.1 Scenario
Suppose there are two participants in a role play:
Participant A: Acted as an application to provide travel recommendation services.
Participant B: Play the role of a user who wants to find an attraction suitable for a weekend trip.
#### Scene setting
User B recently had a few days of vacation and wanted to relax in a place not far from his city. He was not sure where to go. Users want detailed recommendations of attractions, including interesting places to go, good places to eat, accommodation suggestions, etc. Users may also mention personal needs, such as "I like the quiet environment" or "I want to try the local cuisine."

### 2.2 Distillation and analysis results
Common needs of users: Users may repeatedly ask for "scenic spot recommendations", "food recommendations", "accommodation recommendations", etc.
Structure of dialogue: Users often start by asking a general question and then go deeper, possibly personalizing their recommendations.
Fixed expressions and intentions: "What are the interesting places?" "restaurant recommendations nearby"
#### Results
Identify the core functional modules of the application:
For a travel recommendation app, the core functions might include modules such as "attraction recommendation", "food recommendation", "Accommodation recommendation", etc.

## 3. Implementation (HighLight Part)
## 4. Sample dialogues
## 5. Discussion (focusing on the capabilities of your app in terms of the dialogues it can handle, and problems you have encountered.
## 6. Future work (that could improve the system)
More conversations and more content. Add UI interface to show the returning infomation from API

code in some form
collected dialogues, distilled dialogues
