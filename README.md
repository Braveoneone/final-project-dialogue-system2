## 1. Introduction
I implement the Interface to API application basing on Lab 1 coding project. The main purpose is to develop a travel recommendation application whose main function is to recommend tourist restaurants, activities, etc. I use a travel information API, such as the TripAdvisor API or Yelp API, to get details, reviews, locations, and so on about individual restaurants. Since it is so challenge to implement in technical perspective, I spent several days to explore and implement it successfully. Therefore, this project is more technical implement than a few conversations flow designing.
### Yelp Fusion API
Website of API: *https://docs.developer.yelp.com/docs/getting-started* 
Provide detailed information about restaurants, hotels, attractions, etc., including opening hours, user reviews, ratings, etc.
Support location query (by city, latitude and longitude, etc.), category filtering (such as restaurants, cafes, attractions, etc.).
Support for multiple languages and partial international data, which is very useful when developing global applications.
## 2. Data collection
### 2.1 Scenario
Suppose there are two participants in a role play:
Participant A: Acted as an application to provide travel recommendation services.
Participant B: Play the role of a user who wants to find an attraction suitable for a weekend trip.
#### Scene setting
User B recently had a few days of vacation and wanted to relax in a place not far from his city. He was not sure where to go. Users want detailed recommendations of attractions, including interesting places to go, good places to eat, accommodation suggestions, etc. Users may also mention personal needs, such as "I like the quiet environment" or "I want to try the local cuisine."  
### 2.2 Distillation and analysis results
Common needs of users: Users may repeatedly ask for "scenic spot recommendations", "food recommendations", "accommodation recommendations", etc.
Structure of dialogue: Users often start by asking a general question and then go deeper, possibly personalizing their recommendations.
Fixed expressions and intentions: "What are the interesting places?" "restaurant recommendations nearby"
#### Results
Identify the core functional modules of the application:
For a travel recommendation app, the core functions might include modules such as "attraction recommendation", "food recommendation", "Accommodation recommendation", etc.
# 3. Implementation (ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€HighLight and Creative PartðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€)
For solving the creative problem of how to implement API in ISU basing on the Lab 1 coding project, I think the key challenge is how to update nlg dynamically. For dynamically updating, I changed the type of NLGMapping from a simple [Move, string] type to Map<Move, string> type. Also, the nlgMapping should be flexible to update instead of const one. Thus, this is only the initial part of nlgMapping. With the following code block, I make it avalible for starting greeting and question conversation for ISU which do not need API update.
```
var nlgMapping: NLGMapping = new Map([
  [{ type: "greet", content: null }, "Hello! You can ask me anything of traveling information!"],
  [{ type: "ask", content: WHQ("kind_res") }, "Which category of restaurant?"],
  [{ type: "sorry", content: null }, "Sorry, I donâ€™t understand."],
  [
    {
      type: "answer",
      content: { predicate: "popular_restaurants", argument: "Swedish" },
    },
    `${console.log("INITIAL")}`
  ],
]);
```
Then I wrote a serious of functions for real time updating of nlgMapping. Since for Map type, we can use Map.set to update key and value of nlgMapping.
```
// Define a function to update nlgmapping for real-time update calls
function updateNLGMapping(key:any, newResponse: any) {
  nlgMapping.set(key, newResponse);
  console.log(`NLGMapping updated: ${JSON.stringify(key)} -> ${newResponse}`);
}
// Accessing data from API and update nlgmapping
async function fetchAndUpdateMapping() {
  const data = await fetchData();
  for (const item of data) {
    const { key, response } = item;
    updateNLGMapping(key, response);  // update mapping
  }
}
// Gets the fetchData function from API
async function fetchData() {
  return [
    { 
      key: {
        type: "answer",
        content: { predicate: "popular_restaurants", argument: "Swedish" },
      },
      response: `The most two popular Swedish restaurants are ${name_1} and ${name_2}.
       Firstly for the restaurant ${name_1}, its address is at ${res_1.location.address1} ${res_1.location.city}
       And its rating is ${res_1.rating}. and its flavour category is ${res_1.categories.map(category => category.title).join(", ")}
       For the second restaurant${name_2}, its address is at ${res_2.location.address1} ${res_2.location.city}
       And its rating is ${res_2.rating}. and its flavour category is ${res_2.categories.map(category => category.title).join(", ")} ` 
    },
    ...
  ];
}
// Periodically call fetchAndUpdateMapping to update nlgMapping data
setInterval(fetchAndUpdateMapping, 6000); // Update every 6 seconds
```
With these async functions, it can be avaliable to update nlgMapping data. Especially for the last row, *setInterval* function, I set to update nlgMapping data every 6 seconds for getting the API data in time. Everything will get back without undefined or null because I used the await qualifier to wait for finishing of JSON data.
```
async function getData() {
  var res= await getTopSwedishRestaurants("Gothenburg");
  if (res && res.length > 0) {
      res_1 = res[0];
      res_2 = res[1];
  } else {
      console.log("No data");
  }
}
getData();
```
Therefore, at the beginning of application, *getTopSwedishRestaurants* starts to get API data and update function would wait for *getTopSwedishRestaurants* to be finished and make every variable assignment. Then with the interface design in **Section 7. Code**, we can access the data following the data struction like res_1.rating for the rate score of the first restaurant, res_2.location.address1 for the restaurant address for the second restaurant and so on.
## 4. Sample dialogues
sys: Hello! You can ask me anything of traveling information!  
usr: what are the most popular restaurants in gothenburg?  
sys: Which category of restaurant?  
usr: Swedish  
sys: The most two popular Swedish restaurants are Sandberg MÃ¥nsson and Smaka.
       Firstly for the restaurant Sandberg MÃ¥nsson, its address is at Magasinsgatan 26 Gothenburg
       And its rating is 4.8. and its flavour category is Swedish, Scandinavian
       For the second restaurantSmaka, its address is at Vasaplatsen 3 GÃ¶teborg
       And its rating is 4.4. and its flavour category is Bars, Swedish.  
## 5. Discussion 
### 5.1 First Challenge
I have spent a long time to implement a real-time interaction between ISU, NLUG and API application. Also, I met many problem, for example, firstly, I realized the Promise method in *isu.ts* like Lab 2:    
```
actors: {
    dme: dme,
    get_api_data: fromPromise<any, null>(async () => { // Just another expolration but didn't work
        return getTopSwedishRestaurants("Gothenburg");
    }),
    
  },
speak_next_moves: ({ context, event }) =>
      context.ssRef.send({
        type: "SPEAK",
        value: {
          utterance: nlg((event as NextMovesEvent).value), //input parameter for nlg
        },
      }),
```
I want to pass the API data by nlg function but it didn't work because I figure out that, when this application start to run, the nlgMapping would be initialized immediately. However, as we know, it will take a few time to POST and GET from remote API. So this is a real technical challenge for me to find another way if I want to implement API basing on our Lab 1 coding.
### 5.2 Second Challenge
Therefore, I turned to another direction like implementing Promise on the function nlg and nlu in *nlug.ts*.
```
// export async function nlg(moves: Move[]): Promise<string> {
//   console.log("generating moves", moves);
//   async function generateMove(move: Move): Promise<string> {
//     const mapping = nlgMapping.find((x) => objectsEqual(x[0], move));
//     if (mapping) {
//       const response = mapping[1];
//      // if (typeof response === "function") {
//         if ( move.content !== null && "Swedish" in move.content?.toString) {
//           const resNames = await getTopSwedishRestaurants("Gothenburg");
//           return `The most popular Swedish restaurants are`+ resNames;
//         }
//         else if(move.content === null){
//           return "ERROR"; 
//         }
//       //}
//       return response as string; // string return
//     }
//     throw new Error(`Failed to generate move ${JSON.stringify(move)}`);
//   }
//   // all moves response
//   const utterances = await Promise.all(moves.map(generateMove));
//   const utterance = utterances.join(" ");
//   console.log("generated utterance:", utterance);
//   return utterance;
// }
```
However, I met a new problem that, the nlg mapping cannot run as normally as before. Since nlg is Promise type of function, but NLGMapping is just a static type, which means it cannot implement asynchronous running between function and function.
### 5.3 Third Challenge
How to design the data structure of API data? Firstly, I observed the data string from Yelp API on developer tool in Chrome. Then, I selected some of important key like name, rating, address, and so on of restaurants. Since some data string like location is combined from two or more data, I design the nested data structures for such data.
### 5.4 Solution
Finally, after a lot of days exploring, coding, testing and debuging, also with figuring out the structure of every coding file in directory, I implement it successfully. I have described the solution with detail in **Section 3. Implementation** and **Section 7. Code**. It's a really creative implement explored by myself.  
## 6. Future work
More conversations and more content. Add UI interface to show the returning infomation from API. Make it like a real recommandation application. I think it will be lots of creative things that I can do for this application. Also, spending so many days on the implement of technique, I have no time for richer design and deeper exploration for Yelp API. Also, it is the free trail version so this API can only return 3 data strings at most.
## 7. Code
*structyelp.ts* is a script designed for storing API returing data according to its format.
```
// Restaurant Interface
interface Business {
    name: string;
    rating: number;
    review_count: number;
    location: Location;
    categories: { title: string }[];
    imageUrl: string;
    isClosed: boolean;
    url: string;
    reviewCount: number;
    phone: string;
    displayPhone: string;
    distance: number;
    businessHours: BusinessHour[];
    attributes: Attributes;
  }

// Restaurant Category Interface
interface Category {
  alias: string;
  title: string;
}

// Restaurant Coordinates Interface
interface Coordinates {
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
}

// Restaurant Location Interface
interface Location {
  address1: string;
  address2: string | null;
  address3: string | null;
  city: string;
  zipCode: string;
  country: string;
  state: string;
  displayAddress: string[];
}

// Restaurant BusinessHour Interface
interface BusinessHour {
  open: OpenHour[];
  hoursType: string;
  isOpenNow: boolean;
}

// Restaurant OpenHour Interface
interface OpenHour {
  isOvernight: boolean;
  start: string;
  end: string;
  day: number;
}

// Others
interface Attributes {
  businessTempClosed: boolean | null;
  menuUrl: string | null;
  open24Hours: boolean | null;
  waitlistReservation: boolean | null;
}

// Yelp json
interface YelpResponse {
  businesses: Business[];
  total: number;
  region: Region;
}

// Center of Region
interface Region {
  center: Coordinates;
}

```
*fetchyelp.ts* is the script for getting raw json data from remote API by GET method. Its main part is an export async *getTopNationRestaurants* function in which *city* name is an input parameter and *Promise<Business[]>* as a return. As for how to write the request url, as we can see from the code, I write the location, categories, limit and sort_by method of rating in API request url.
```
// Yelp API Key
const API_KEY = "lZZgHuBl_udnkqGwQvIZGfzaItFdMyHbe-gMb2ysImc9VXgl55Njo_bkmRiBrLW0CHj3uLoZxH7lVU2_kcG04rV8VWazltgxEN2TiLyC4lU5CdYxaQ11hfvAcg4pZ3Yx";
export let res_name: string[] = [];
export async function getTopSwedishRestaurants(city: string, limit: number = 3): Promise<Business[]> {
    const url = `https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search?location=${encodeURIComponent(city)}&categories=swedish&sort_by=rating&limit=${limit}`;
    try {
      const response = await fetch(url, {
        method: "GET",
        headers: {
          "Authorization": `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }
      });
      // check whether it is successful
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`error of response: ${response.statusText}`);
      }
      // json data
      const data = await response.json();
      const businesses: Business[] = data.businesses;
      let count_res = 0;
      // most three
      businesses.forEach((business) => {
        count_res = count_res + 1;
        console.log(`--------------------Restaurant ${count_res}------------------------------`);
        console.log(`name: ${business.name}`);
        console.log(`rating: ${business.rating}`);
        console.log(`comments: ${business.review_count}`);
        console.log(`address: ${business.location.address1}, ${business.location.city}`);
        console.log(`category: ${business.categories.map(category => category.title).join(", ")}`);
        console.log("-------------------------------------------------------------------------");
      });
      return businesses;//, data.map((business: any) => business.rating);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error:", error);
    }
    let no_data: Business[] = [];
    return no_data;
  }
